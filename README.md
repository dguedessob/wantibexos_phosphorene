Input (input.dat) example for the WantiBEXOS (WTBX) code used in our calculations for Bethe-Salpeter equation solution.\
All the parameters are discussed in the manuscript and computational details can be accessed in the WTBX manual at https://wantibexos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  \
All the Hamiltonians obtained through the Wannier90 code and converted to the WTBX format are availabe in the directories named from each vdW correction employed.
